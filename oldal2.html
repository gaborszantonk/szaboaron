    If you are getting the Acer computer black screen even when the system is turned on, then you can try the following fixes.
    
    Fix 1: Power Reset your Laptop
    To start with, I'm going to list the simplest way to fix the Acer Aspire black screen problem. If there is a minor issue with its firmware or booting, then you can try to power reset your laptop. To do this, just press the Power button on your laptop and keep holding it for at least 15 seconds.

For this, I would recommend connecting your system with an external monitor. You can use the connecting cable and simply fix it with an external monitor. If you get the correct display on the external monitor, then it means the problem is with your laptop's screen (and not its firmware).
